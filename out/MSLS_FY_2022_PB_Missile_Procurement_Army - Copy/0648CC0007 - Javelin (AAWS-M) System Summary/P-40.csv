"Description: Javelin is a man-portable, fire-and-forget, medium-range missile with enhanced situational awareness and precision direct-fire effects to defeat armored vehicles, fortifications, and soft targets in a range of military operations. Javelin has a high kill rate against a variety of targets at extended ranges under day/night, battlefield obscurants, adverse weather and multiple counter-measure conditions. The system's soft launch feature permits firing from a fighting position or an enclosure. Javelin uses a modular design to allow the system to evolve to meet changing threats and requirements via both software and hardware upgrades. The system consists of a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a built-in-test (BIT), and a modular missile encased in a disposable launch tube assembly. The system also includes training devices for tactical training and classroom training. Javelin's fire-and-forget technology allows the gunner to fire and immediately take cover, to move to another fighting position, or to reload. The Javelin provides enhanced lethality through the use of a tandem multi-purpose warhead which will defeat all known armor threats. It is effective against both stationary and moving targets. This system also provides defensive capability against attacking/hovering helicopters. In current conflicts the CLU is being used as a stand-alone surveillance and target acquisition asset. The Javelin weapon system is an Army-led, Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) that has joint interest with the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
