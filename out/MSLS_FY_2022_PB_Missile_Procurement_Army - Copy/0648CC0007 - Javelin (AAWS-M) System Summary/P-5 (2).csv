"Remarks: Lightweight CLU unit prices will be reduced significantly once full-rate production in achieved, and will be further reduced by combining Army procurement quantities with other U.S. services and foreign military sales quantities. Procurement funding reduction in FY21 & FY22 decreases FY21 quantity from 10 to 5 and FY22 quantity from 212 to 86. Beginning in FY2022, the project office will start appropriately allocating some Government Support costs to the Javelin Lightweight CLU Funding line (H06103) for personnel and government agencies that support the Lightweight CLU procurement efforts. No allocation was made for Government Support costs in FY21 because the majority of funds were for Initial Production Facilitization. Fielding costs include initial consumables including Battery Coolant Units (BCU). Facilitization costs include cost to set up a new production line for Lightweight CLU builds. LW CLU initial LRIP of 5 units is planned for FY2021, with a ramp-up to a second LRIP of 86 units in FY2022 prior to reaching Full Rate Production (FRP) of ~300/year in FY2023. First Unit Equipped (FUE) is planned for 4QFY2024.",,,,,,,,,
