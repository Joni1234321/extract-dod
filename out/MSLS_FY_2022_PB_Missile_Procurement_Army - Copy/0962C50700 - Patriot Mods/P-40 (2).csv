"Communications Obsolescence: Task is to replace obsolete PATRIOT communications equipment that is no longer supportable, with modern communications equipment for four PATRIOT Battalions. The fielded PATRIOT communications architecture utilizes obsolete serial technology that is no longer producible or repairable. This process requires modernization at battalion (BN) level to prevent breaking intra- BN communications, addresses the BN specific architecture to facilitate modern external and external communications. These measures provide an interim solution until transition to fleet-wide AIAMD system architecture is achieved, and is an essential step to keep the remainder of the fleet viable until it is fully replaced with AIAMD components. The Battery Command Post/Tactical Command System/Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) effort continues the development of the Capabilities Development Document (CDD) required Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) capability to maintain compatibility with tactical software enhancements, while enhancing and improving the defense design and planning capabilities for the PATRIOT warfighter. This includes systems engineering, software requirements, software design/code/test and independent validation and verification testing. This effort also provides Integrated Logistics Support, required due to the large amount of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components, of the 62 Battery Command Posts and 17 Tactical Command Systems. Additionally, this effort supports the BCP/TCS/CSM fielding upgrades for each PATRIOT Post Deployment Build update. Note: Quantities procured and installed in prior years. PATRIOT's IESP is a US chartered multi-national cost sharing program which allows the current 16 FMS partners to contribute toward common, non-RDTE engineering activities required to sustain PATRIOT capability. This cost share program structure is at a ratio of 2:1 FMS dollars to USD investment. Consolidated funds provide essential engineering services toward enhancing PATRIOT fleet readiness for both the United States Army and International partners. Significant cost avoidance is achieved by sharing expenses that would otherwise be fully funded by the United States to achieve the same result. Logistics Recurring includes all aspects of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management, e.g., maintenance support, facilities, personnel, training, testing, and fielding. Report Rocket Classification: The modern Air and Missile Defense environment contains a wide variety and large quantities of TBM and rocket threats. This task provides situational awareness for operators and allows for greater efficiency in management of interceptor inventories in the complex AMD environment. Patriot Multi-Echelon Training (PMET), Reconfigurable Table Top Trainer (RT3): The PATRIOT Weapons System uses tactical equipment and training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) to conduct multi-level training for both operators and maintenance personnel. This includes both hardware devices and software programs utilized to include; the Patriot Maintenance Trainer (PMT), Reconfigurable Table Top Trainer (RT3) and the Patriot Multi-Echelon Training (PMET). The PMT was fielded to the Air Defense Artillery Schools at Fort Sill, OK. The PMT trains 14E, 140E, 14T, 94S and 948D 6D tasks. It reduces dependency on tactical equipment by merging physical simulators and virtual simulations replicating a realistic training environment. The PMT includes one instructor station, one radar set, one launching station, and an engagement control station. Some components are actual physical representations of the tactical hardware while other components are virtually simulated using state of the art gaming technology of PMET. The two environments work seamlessly together to simulate the tactical end items. PMET is a Microsoft Windows based software application utilizing state of the art gaming technology to train U.S. Army personnel in the proper trouble-shooting techniques to repair and maintain the PATRIOT Missile System. PMET is the Life Cycle Replacement for the PATRIOT Intermediate Maintenance Institutional Trainer (PIMIT) for Intermediate Maintenance training but is also used for Organizational, NET, and Depot maintenance training. PMET is used in an institutional, field and depot environment. PMET is designed and developed to operate on the RT3. The RT3 provides a flexible training platform that may be configured to support multiple training levels and systems, via removable hard drives. In PATRIOT the RT3 is used to run the PATRIOT tactical embedded training software (re-hosted tactical training software, PATRIOT Conduct of Fire Trainer (PCOFT)) for operations tasks, the PMET software for maintenance tasks, and the PATRIOT Skills Library (PSL) lessons for both maintenance and operator tasks. Other weapon systems may also use the RT3 platform for training (i.e., C-RAM, and THAAD). The RT3 is a Life Cycle Replacement for the PCOFT and the PIMIT hardware platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
