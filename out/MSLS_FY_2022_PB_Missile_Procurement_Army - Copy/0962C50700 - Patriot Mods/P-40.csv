"Description: The PATRIOT Mods program implements critical capability, readiness and sustainability modifications to the weapon system, maintains Integrated Logistics Support, and supports materiel solutions to counter cybersecurity and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space. Required modifications are identified through various means to include: validated requirement documents such as the Capability Production Document (CPD), Capabilities Development Document (CDD), and the Operational Needs Statement (ONS); material changes supported by improved operational effectiveness as identified in the PATRIOT Product Improvement Program (PIP); material deficiencies identified in the field; obsolescence mitigation; emerging technologies; software improvements related to warfighter machine and crew interface requirements and communication upgrades. Modifications outlined below are critical to maintain capabilities in the field for enduring PATRIOT components, or is critical in support of the transition to an Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) in convergence efforts with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS). FY22 PATRIOT Mods funding supports International Engineering Services Program (IESP); Integrated Logistics Support (ILS); US Unique Engineering Services (ES); System Engineering and Technical Analysis activities supporting Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Mods; Recapitalization (RECAP); Battery Command Post/ Tactical Command System /Computer Software Module (BCP/TCS/CSM) Mod; Communications Obsolescence Upgrade, continued unit ONS fielding support while awaiting the Army standard solution, and Report Rocket Classification. RAM modifications provide resolution to field failures which are identified through component analysis, field data collection, obsolescence issues and emerging technologies which are prioritized based on readiness and Operations and Support (O&S) impacts. This effort includes the engineering, acquisition, qualification testing, installation, technical support and training device upgrades associated with modification and design changes which are essential to stabilize the system at the highest readiness posture available and reduction of O&S. Kit quantity is based on expected Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to be applied to Major End Items (MEIs). Quantities will be procured at an optimized rate utilizing price advantage created through contract negotiation, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales into a buy-to-budget procurement strategy. Recapitalization (RECAP) Modifications include critical upgrades including but not limited to: Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), PATRIOT-unique prime mover obsolescence mitigation, Depot Maintenance Plant Equipment (DMPE), Harmonic Generator Kits, Post Deployment Build 8.1 (PDB-8.1) and Patriot Component Software Build (PCSB) S/W & H/W, Cryptographic Modernization Kits, Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) Launching station upgrades; Radar Digital Sidelobe Canceller upgrade, Radar Weapons Control Interface Unit (RWCIU) obsolescence mitigation, Radar Search/Track Microwave Front Ends modernization, Radar Peripheral Electronics Assembly (PEA) box modernization, Electronic Power Plant (EPP) obsolescence mitigation, and Cooling Liquid Electron Tube (CLET) kits. These modifications are synchronized within the RECAP program. RECAP is a battalion set, resulting in a more supportable, reliable, and capable unit in the force. Quantity represents 1 battalion a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
