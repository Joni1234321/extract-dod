"Justification: FY2022 procurement dollars in the amount of $5.019 million support continuing acquisition of Patriot Modification Initial Spares. The funds in this account procure depot level repairable (DLR) secondary items from Supply Management, Army activities of the Army Working Capital Fund and commercial life cycle support vendors. To provide initial issue spares support, funds are required in the same year that end items are fielded. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
