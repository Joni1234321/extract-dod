"Justification: FY2022 All-up Round Unit Cost is based on a total qty of 3,937 missiles across all Customers. The Air-to-Ground Missile Systems (AGMS) Family of Munitions Production Capacity of 11,000 is shared by all customers (Army, AF, Navy, & FMS) and all AGMS missile variants (HF, JAGM, & Trainers). FY2022 has an available capacity of 7,811 AGMS missiles. FY2022 Direct War dollars in the amount of $118.8M will procure 900 HELLFIRE missiles for the Army.. The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement and/or Foreign Military sales (FMS) to increase the Army procurement of HELLFIRE II missiles. The historical Army Acquisition Objective was 34,292. HELLFIRE will achieve TMR in FY22 with the delivery of missiles procured in FY19. HELLFIRE Product Office is the Procuring Agency for all Services. HELLFIRE is reliant on other services and FMS to meet the Minimum Sustainment Rate (MSR) of 1200 missiles. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
