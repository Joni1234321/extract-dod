"Description: The HELLFIRE II and Longbow family of air-to-ground missiles (all variants) provide attack helicopters and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with point-target precision strike capability to defeat heavy, advanced armor, individual hard point and non-traditional targets. HELLFIRE II Missiles use a semi-active laser terminal guidance and are the primary armaments of the AH-64 Apache, Army UAS and Special Operations aircraft. The HELLFIRE II includes Electro-Optical Countermeasure capability, warhead improvements and an updated electronic fuze. The AGM-114R HELLFIRE II family of missiles replaces all other HELLFIRE II missile configurations (K/N/M/P) except HELLFIRE Longbow. HELLFIRE II procurement funding supports the entire HELLFIRE II and HELLFIRE Longbow systems to include resolution of obsolescence, end- of-life buys, safety, insensitive munitions, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, facilitization, production ramp-up activities and production issues. This missile is compatible on all current force UAS and rotary wing platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
