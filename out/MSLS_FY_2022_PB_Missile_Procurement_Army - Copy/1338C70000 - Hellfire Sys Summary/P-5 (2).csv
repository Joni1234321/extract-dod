"Remarks: Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) The production unit cost is based on all Services' base and Direct War and Enduring quantity requirements known at this time. Above quantities are Army only. Total quantities include procurement by US Air Force, US Navy, US Army and FMS cases. Excess capacity will determine future FMS quantity availability. All procurement of Hellfire II AGM-114R missiles are reflected on the P21. Exhibit P-5: While the Laser HELLFIRE overall Program Management Administration (PMA) and Production Engineering Support (PES) costs maintain a consistent level of effort each year, these costs are allocated to all services on a pro-rata share of quantities procured. This can result in a year-to-year fluctuation of the Army's share. Based on contract structure, all customers pay the same Unit Cost for the same configuration.",,,,,,,,,
