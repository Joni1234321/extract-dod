"Description: ATACMS is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. The missile provides the Combatant Commanders with a 24/7 all-weather 300 kilometers (km) long-range fires capability to attack high-payoff, time-sensitive targets. ATACMS continues as the Commanders long range precision missile until fielding of the Army's objective system, Precision Strike Missile. This procurement is related to the qualification program funded under Program Element (PE) 0203802A. Block (BLK) I/IA missiles are aging beyond their service life and have warheads that are non-compliant with the Department of Defense (DoD) cluster munitions (CM) policy. This modification is performed as a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and will convert expired assets into Unitary HOB missiles with a reset 10 year service life. This modification replaces the existing M74 bomblets with a policy compliant unitary warhead, updates electronics and propellants, and adds a proximity sensor. This effort effectively brings the expired inventory back into service while meeting the DoD CM policy. Multi-mode seeker kits are also added for CD ATACMS missiles to engage moving maritime and land targets. ATACMS modifications performed by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Grand Prairie, TX will stop production after FY 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
