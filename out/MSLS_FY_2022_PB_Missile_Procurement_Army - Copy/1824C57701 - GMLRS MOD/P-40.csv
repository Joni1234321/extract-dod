"Description: FY 2021 funding totals include $0.0M for Base and $0.0M for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). This effort shall be complete in FY 2020. No further funding is required. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all- weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges. The GMLRS Program currently consists of multiple variants: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage. GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) was developed as a non-cluster munition to engage the same target sets as DPICM. GMLRS Unitary and AW are currently in full rate production. The U.S. Army manages all three variants as part of the GMLRS Program. This modification program along with all GMLRS rockets are produced on a common production line by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
