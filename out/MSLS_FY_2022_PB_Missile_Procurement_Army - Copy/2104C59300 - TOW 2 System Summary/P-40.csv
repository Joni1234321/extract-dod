"Description: Tube launched, Optically tracked, Wire - less guided (TOW) missiles (BGM-71 Series) are combat proven munitions that provide heavy anti-armor/assault capability to the Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Armor Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT). TOW missiles continue to be used as the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements. TOW missiles are also the primary heavy anti-armor/ assault missile for the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and more than 43 allied nations. Warfighters also employ TOW missiles against buildings and field fortifications, taking advantage of the missile's precision assault capabilities. The TOW Weapon System includes the ITAS launcher, TOW missiles, and associated tactical training aids/devices. The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) is a combat proven TOW missile launcher that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active, Reserve, and National Guard component Infantry and SBCT across a spectrum of operational environments. The USMC employs the TOW missile from its ITAS derived M41A7 Saber launchers, and Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
