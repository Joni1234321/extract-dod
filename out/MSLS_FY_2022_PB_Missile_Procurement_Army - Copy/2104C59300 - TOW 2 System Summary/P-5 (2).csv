"Remarks: The P-5 Cost Elements for FY22 were restructured and cost estimates were updated and realigned to improve tracking and reporting of actuals. This update also increases consistency in P-5 reporting across the Tactical Aviation and Ground Munitions portfolio. - Support Element ""System Engineering"" is now under Recurring Cost and is labeled ""Engineering Services"" - Support Element ""Acceptance Test"" is now under Recurring Cost - Support Element ""Government Management"" was split into ""Production Engineering"" and ""Government Management""; increase in funding facilitates mitigation of obsolescence and safety concerns to production missile variants. FY22 funding in the amount of $104.412 million procures 887 TOW 2B Aero missiles and provides combat inventory at levels required by the US Army's Total Munitions Requirement. FY22 TOW 2B unit price estimate assumes additional customer procurement of missiles to reach Minimum Sustaining Rate. FY22 procurement of $6.076M procures CAPS hardware for component and system tests and conducts the component level qualification of the CAPS hardware. The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales to increase the Army procurement of TOW missiles and to mitigate safety and obsolescence issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
