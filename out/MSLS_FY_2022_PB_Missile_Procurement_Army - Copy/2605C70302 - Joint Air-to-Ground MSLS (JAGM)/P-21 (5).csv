"Remarks: FY 2021 and FY 2022 total quantities include Navy purchases. While production lead time is 24 months, the ordering window for contract awards may extend up to six months after award. Production does not begin until the ordering window is closed. Production contracts include a clause that precludes concurrent delivery of successive contract or contract option awards. (â€¡) Delivery rows marked with this symbol indicate that they are funded through a separate Line Item. See the respective components' exhibits for details, including the full delivery schedule. ""A"" in the Delivery Schedule indicates the Contract Award Date. Note: Due to space limitations, quantities in the Exhibit P-21 delivery calendar are truncated and rounded based on the maximum quantity in the calendar as follows. If the maximum quantity is less than or equal to than 9,999, all quantities are shown as each. If the maximum quantity is between 10,000 and 999,999 all quantities are shown in thousands. If the maximum quantity is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999 all quantities are shown in millions (rounded to the nearest thousand).If the maximum quantity is equal or greater than 1,000,000,000 all quantities are shown in billions (rounded to the nearest million).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
