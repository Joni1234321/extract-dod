"Description: The JAGM program is an Army-led, Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1C Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) with joint interest with the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. JAGM is the next generation, multi-mode, air-to-ground munition replacing legacy HELLFIRE (HF) and HF Longbow munitions. JAGM will be used for destruction of high-value land and maritime targets, moving or stationary, and is capable of being fired from any platform currently firing HF from a US Army-issued M299 launcher. JAGM utilizes a HF back-end (propulsion, warhead and control system) with a new-design, Millimeter Wave (MMW) and Semi-Active Laser (SAL), multi-mode guidance section. The multi-mode capability provides fire-and-forget and precision-point targeting as well as unique, blended modes of each, for improved capability over legacy munitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
