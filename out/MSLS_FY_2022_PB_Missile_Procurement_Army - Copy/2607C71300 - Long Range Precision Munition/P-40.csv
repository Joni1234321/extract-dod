"Description: The LRPM will provide Army Aviation with improved and longer range weapons, sub-systems, and munitions that can rapidly respond in a combat environment improving the survivability of the warfighters and weapon systems in an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) denied environment. The ability to interoperate and coordinate with other weapon systems and munitions at long ranges and adapt to changing threats is a core concept of the Army Aviation Weapons Sub-Systems and Munitions (AAWSSM) program. The Spike Non-line of Sight (NLOS) directed requirement will federate an existing production system to the Apache AH-64 as an interim solution that will provide longer stand-off ranges in an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environment until a more effective integrated Army Aviation Weapons Sub-Systems and Munitions (AAWSSM) LRPM solution can be developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
