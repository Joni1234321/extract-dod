"Description: The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, shoulder-fired and platform mounted guided missile system that provides the maneuver force and point defense assets air defense protection. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against Fixed Wing (FW) and Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). The Stinger missile is deployable from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters, UAS and Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance. The Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is ongoing at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant to replace aging key components in existing Block I missiles to extend the current shelf life providing a more viable asset to the Army's inventory. The addition of a Proximity Fuze (PROX) capability in FY 2019 provided improved effectiveness against UAS threats by eliminating the need for hit to kill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
