"Description: Avenger is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The system protects against unmanned aircraft systems, cruise missiles, and fixed and rotary wing threats. Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. It can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable. The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P) for close-in ground and air threats. An Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide. The Avenger fleet of 453 systems includes 169 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement. The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) addresses obsolescence of five key Avenger components to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through FY 2031. The Vehicle Internal Communications System is a required subsystem that allows communication between the gunner and driver. It also interfaces with the IFF and missile electronics resulting in improved IFF capabilities. The digital VIC-5 replaces the analog VIC-1 that is currently fielded with the Avenger. The Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC) is a required subsystem of the Avenger Slew-to-Cue system that processes and displays air tracks data to the gunner. The current AFCC is not supportable through FY 2031. The AFCC will undergo software and hardware upgrades that will enable the system to handle increased targeting capability realized with the latest version of the FAAD early warning system, ensure the system meets the latest Information Assurance (IA) requirements, and allow for future growth in areas such as improved fire control/longer range engagements. The Mode 5 IFF is required to replace the Mode 4 IFF, in order to comply with Department of Defense standards. Incorporation of Mode 5 IFF into Avenger is critical to retaining the cooperative target identification capability, allowing Avenger to remain relevant and effective in Air Defense and Homeland Defense missions. Mode 5 IFF quantities above 453 also support the Stinger Man Portable Air Defense System Initiative. Additional Obsolescence Mitigation Items, in various quantities, support 453 Avenger systems and include Avenger Organizational Maintenance Tool Kits, AN/PSM-95 Electronic Systems Test Sets and Avenger Remote Handheld Terminal Unit (RHTU) mounting kits. The TC and AFCC are fielded to the 169 STC Avengers only. The M3P is fielded as spares through the supply system. The VIC-5 and Mode 5 IFF are fielded to all 453 of the Avenger systems. In prior years, the Avenger MODS program also addressed the Slew-to-Cue upgrade, Targeting Consoles (TC) and M3P .50 CAL machine guns.",,,,,,,,,
