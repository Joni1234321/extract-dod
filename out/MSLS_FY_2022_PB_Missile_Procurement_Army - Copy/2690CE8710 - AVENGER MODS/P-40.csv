"Description: Avenger is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The system protects against unmanned aircraft systems, cruise missiles, and fixed and rotary wing threats. Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability. It can be air dropped, lifted by helicopter and is air transportable. The system employs up to eight Stinger missiles to counter aerial threats and a .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P) for close-in ground and air threats. An Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system aids in the identification of friendly aircraft in order to minimize the potential for fratricide. The Avenger fleet of 453 systems includes 169 systems that are equipped with a digital Slew-to-Cue (STC) capability to speed target detection and engagement. The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. The ongoing MOD-SLEP addresses obsolescence of Avenger components to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through FY 2031. Five key MOD-SLEP components are: the Targeting Console (TC), the M3P, the Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), the Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and the Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC-5). Additional Obsolescence Mitigation Items include Avenger Organizational Maintenance Tool Kits, AN/PSM-95 Electronic Systems Test Set and the Avenger Remote Handheld Terminal Unit (RHTU) mounting kits. The TC and AFCC are fielded to the 169 STC Avengers only. The M3P is fielded as spares through the supply system. The VIC-5 and Mode 5 IFF are fielded to all 453 of the Avenger systems. The Product Office will use FY 2022 funding to provide Systems Engineering, Engineering Services, Program Management and Fielding support necessary to complete MOD-SLEP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
