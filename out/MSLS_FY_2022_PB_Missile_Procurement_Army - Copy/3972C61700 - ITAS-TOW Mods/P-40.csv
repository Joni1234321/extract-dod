"Description: The Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) with Far Target Location (FTL) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) equipped with Modified ITAS (MITAS) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS with the TOW Missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets with its ability to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location. The ITAS completed fielding to the total Army in December 2012. ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
