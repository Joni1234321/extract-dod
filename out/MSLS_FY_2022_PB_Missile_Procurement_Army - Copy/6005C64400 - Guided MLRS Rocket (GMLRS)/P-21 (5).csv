"Remarks: In the years prior to FY 2020, the GMLRS program shares a production line with Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rockets (LCRRPR). Any months that show production gaps in years prior to FY 2020 were utilized to manufacture LCRRPR. After FY 2020, LCRRPR will move to its own production line and GMLRS will be delivered on a monthly schedule with no gaps. (â€¡) Delivery rows marked with this symbol indicate that they are funded through a separate Line Item. See the respective components' exhibits for details, including the full delivery schedule. ""A"" in the Delivery Schedule indicates the Contract Award Date.

If the maximum quantity is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999 all quantities are shown in millions (rounded to the nearest thousand).If the maximum quantity is equal or greater than 1,000,000,000 all quantities are shown in billions (rounded to the nearest million).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
