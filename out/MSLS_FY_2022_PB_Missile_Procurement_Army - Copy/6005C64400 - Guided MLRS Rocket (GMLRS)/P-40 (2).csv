"Justification: The FY 2022 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $747.813 million support the procurement of 4,650 rockets. The FY 2022 Direct War procurement dollars in the amount of $187.615 million support the procurement of 1,236 rockets. $0.489 million of Base procurement dollars support the acquisition of equipment and support to ensure Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Common Training Device alignment with the production configuration. The actual missile buy quantities are subject to the mix between AW and Unitary warheads, Standard (regular range) versus Extended Range configurations, replacement pod cut- in, and replacement pod/Extended Range ECP tooling capacity ramp-up. In FY 2022, Army guidance is to procure 600 Standard Unitary and 5,286 Standard Alternative Warhead (AW) in support of the Army's Total Munitions Requirement (TMR). The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales to support procurement of additional GMLRS rockets.TMR quantities are evaluated and adjusted annually. As of May, 2020, the TMR showed requirements for Unitary of 18,423 and for AW of 66,289. Since program inception, GMLRS has benefited from the availability of 30 year old M-26 pods that are repurposed for current GMLRS production. Due to dwindling supply of these pods, procurement of replacement pods must begin in FY 2022. The AAO is 140,004. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
