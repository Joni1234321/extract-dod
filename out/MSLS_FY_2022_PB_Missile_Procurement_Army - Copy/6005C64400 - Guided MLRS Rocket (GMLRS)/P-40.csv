"Description: NOTE: P-40 Quantity: FY 2021: Actual quantity is 5,796. FY 2022: P40 Quantity is correct vice the P1 5817 quantity. Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges. The U.S. Marine Corps also procures GMLRS rockets through the Army project office. The GMLRS Program currently consists of multiple variants: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage. GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) was developed as a non-cluster munition to engage the same target sets as DPICM. GMLRS Unitary and AW are currently in full rate production. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is currently in process to extend the range of GMLRS rockets and, upon completion of key development tests, the ER GMLRS will be considered for cut-in to the GMLRS production efforts as early as FY22. Range extension will allow GMLRS to reach targets formerly serviced by the more expensive Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
