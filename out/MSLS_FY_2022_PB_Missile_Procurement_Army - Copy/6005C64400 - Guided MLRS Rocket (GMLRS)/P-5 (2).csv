"Remarks: The Army fully transitioned to Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System Motors (IMPS) for all rockets in FY 2020. Procurement of tooling for Extended Range GMLRS and for manufacture of pods was previously scheduled for FY 2021, however, it has since become necessary to implement a Life Time Buy of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips in order to assure continuing supply of Guidance Sets. Due to this development, the Extended Range GMLRS tooling has been shifted into FY 2022. The cost to procure the ASIC chips is estimated to be $60M and will enable production to continue through FY 2026, at which time a replacement shall become available. FY 2022 is the first year that shall require the production of pods for the GMLRS program rather than making use of repurposed M26 pods that were freely available in past years. These factors, coupled with increased procurement of the more expensive AW variant to support the Army's TMR, lead to an overall unit cost growth. Costs for Engineering Change Proposals covers activities associated with resolving manufacturing-related changes that arise due to emerging statutory and regulatory requirements, planned and unplanned parts unavailability, supply chain disruptions, cost reduction initiatives, quality improvement, and studies and investigations. Some of the currently known issues that must be resolved include obsolescence of certain components within the safe arm fuze, proximity sensor, guidance set, and motor material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
