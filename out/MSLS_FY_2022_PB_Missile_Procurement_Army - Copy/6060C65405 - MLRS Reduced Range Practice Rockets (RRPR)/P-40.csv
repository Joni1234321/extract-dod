"Description: The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) is the only live training rocket that meets the annual certification and pre-deployment requirements for Active and National Guard High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and M270/M270A1 MLRS launcher units. The critical validated requirement for launcher units ensures units can achieve and maintain combat readiness. HIMARS and M270A1 Battalions are organic and attached to modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint Expeditionary Force, and Joint Special Operations Force combatant commanders. The training rocket has an inert payload section and blunt nose for inducing reduced range for use at multiple facilities in the United States and foreign countries. LCRRPRs are manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas and Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. LEMC provides an organic dual source. The LCRRPR program includes the cost to Download/Demate (DL/DM) the M26 pod and rocket motor for production reuse. Total cost also includes Bunker Storage and the procurement of Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) boxes, Inert Warheads, Reworked Igniters, M-26 Rocket Motor Reclamation contract, and RRPR obsolescence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
