"Remarks: US Army has no funding for Army HIMARS launcher procurement in FY20, however there are 10 USMC HIMARS launchers and 18 FMS HIMARS launchers being produced by the prime contractor. Due to a unique limitation with the Army's budget justification database, only rows that have a matching US ARMY manufacturer and FY will appear on the budget justification document. (â€¡) Delivery rows marked with this symbol indicate that they are funded through a separate Line Item. See the respective components' exhibits for details, including the full delivery schedule. ""A"" in the Delivery Schedule indicates the Contract Award Date. Note: Due to space limitations, quantities in the Exhibit P-21 delivery calendar are truncated and rounded based on the maximum quantity in the calendar as follows. If the maximum quantity is less than or equal to than 9,999, all quantities are shown as each. If the maximum quantity is between 10,000 and 999,999 all quantities are shown in thousands. If the maximum quantity is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999 all quantities are shown in millions (rounded to the nearest thousand).If the maximum quantity is equal or greater than 1,000,000,000 all quantities are shown in billions (rounded to the nearest million).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
