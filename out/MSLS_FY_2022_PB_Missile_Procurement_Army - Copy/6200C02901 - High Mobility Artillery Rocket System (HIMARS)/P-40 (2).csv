"Justification: FY2022 procurement dollars support $128.438M Base, $0.000M Direct War, and $0.000M Enduring costs. FY2022 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $128.438 million procures 19 M142 HIMARS launchers and associated equipment. The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales to support additional HIMARS launchers and Fleet Expansion. The FY2021 and FY2022 flyaway cost for the HIMARS launchers have been revised to include costs for Prime Mission Equipment (Launcher), Contractor System Engineering/Program Management, and System Test & Evaluation. In the PB21 P-Form submission, the FY2021 flyaway cost for HIMARS launchers only included costs for the Prime Mission Equipment (Launcher), thus the PB21 P-Form FY2021 flyaway cost was understated, resulting in an understated unit cost. This FY2021 and FY2022 change has been made to more accurately reflect the flyaway cost of a HIMARS launcher. In FY2021, the Army requested the transfer of $10M from OMA line 121 to MIPA to procure one National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS) launcher. The $10M of Missile Procurement, Army (MIPA) funding was included on the existing HIMARS line in the FY21 Appropriation. The Army Budget Office (ABO) established a new budget line (Cruise Missiles, SSN C21600), and the $10M NASAMS funds will be reprogrammed for execution into the new line during the second quarter of FY21. Currently, the inclusion of $10M NASAMS funding skews the Gross Weapon System Unit Cost for the HIMARS launcher. This unit cost will correct once the $10M is reprogrammed from the HIMARS budget line. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
