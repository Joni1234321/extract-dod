"Description: The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-Unitary (GMLRS-U), GMLRS Alternative Warhead, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and future MFOM to include the Extended Range (ER) GMLRS, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). In FY2017, the Army directed the program office to produce additional HIMARS launchers in an effort called HIMARS Fleet Expansion. The Army currently has 363 HIMARS launchers on hand and is increasing the Army Acquisition Objective to 547 to support the Army Structure Memorandum 2022-2026 decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
