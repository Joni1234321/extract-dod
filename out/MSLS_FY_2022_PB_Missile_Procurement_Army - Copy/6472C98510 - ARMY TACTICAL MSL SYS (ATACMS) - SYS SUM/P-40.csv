"Description: NOTE: All funds for this program were previously included in CA6700 ATACMS Mods in support of New Missiles. There is no funding for FY 2022. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. The missile provides the Combatant Commanders with a 24/7 all-weather 300 kilometers (km) long-range fires capability to attack high-payoff, time-sensitive targets without placing aircraft and crews at risk. It's precision accuracy, along with the absence of potential duds and reduced lethal radii, mitigate the warfighter's collateral damage concerns against hard and soft targets in complex and urban environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
