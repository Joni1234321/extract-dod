"Justification: FY2022 procurement dollars support $273.856M Base, $0.000M Direct War, and $0.000M Enduring costs. FY 2022 procurement dollars in the amount of $273.856 million procures 30 M270A2 MLRS launchers and 35 Improved Armored Cabs. Supports MLRS Fleet Expansion (Mod 1) of 26 MLRS launchers from M270A0 configuration to M270A2 configuration and completes the nonrecurring engineering obsolescence effort of the launcher chassis design. Supports MLRS Fleet Upgrade (Mod 2) of 4 MLRS launchers from M270A1 configuration to M270A2 configuration. Procures 35 Improved Armored Cabs (Mod 3). The Army intends to convert any price advantage created through contract negotiations, other service procurement, and/or foreign military sales to continue the MLRS Fleet Upgrade (Mod 2) of MLRS launchers from M270A1 configuration to M270A2 configuration, and/or address obsolescence, modernization, cost reduction, and production initiatives. The Army will continue to incorporate modifications with the MLRS launcher to keep pace with the current and evolving threat. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
