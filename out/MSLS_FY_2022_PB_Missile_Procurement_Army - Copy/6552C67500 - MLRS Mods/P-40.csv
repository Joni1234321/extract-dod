"Description: The M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (ER GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). In FY2017, the Army directed the program office to modernize 160 obsolete, unserviceable MLRS M270A0s to M270A2s in an effort called MLRS Fleet Expansion. In addition to MLRS Fleet Expansion, the Army decided to extend the operational life of the existing M270A1 fleet to FY2050 or beyond, which drives the requirement to upgrade the current fleet of 225 M270A1 launchers to the M270A2 configuration. The end state is 367 MLRS launchers with Improved Armored Cabs (IAC), Bradley commonality improvements, and Common Fire Control System (CFCS). Upon integration of the IAC Modification Kit on a M270A1, the launcher permanently becomes an M270A2. Mod 1 (MLRS Fleet Expansion). The Fleet Expansion effort will modernize 160 MLRS M270A0s to M270A2s through a Public Private Partnership. The prime contractor and Red River Army Depot (RRAD) will rebuild, address obsolescence and provide selective upgrades to include IAC, Bradley commonality improvements, and CFCS. Mod 2 (MLRS Fleet Upgrade). The MLRS Fleet upgrade effort will follow the same rebuild process and selective upgrades as the Fleet Expansion effort, by upgrading the current fleet of M270A1 launchers to M270A2 with IAC, Bradley Commonality, and CFCS. Upon integration of the IAC Modification Kit on a M270A1, the launcher permanently becomes a M270A2. This upgrade effort will extend the operational life of these launchers to FY2050 and beyond. Mod 3 (Improved Armored Cab). The Improved Armored Cab (IAC) Modification Kit provides crew survivability against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and small arms fire greater than or equal to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) Increased Crew Protection Cab (ICP). Additionally, IAC standardizes crew drill requirements between HIMARS and MLRS operators. Upon integration of the IAC Modification Kit on a M270A1, the launcher permanently becomes a M270A2. Integration of the IAC is performed by RRAD under a Public Private Partnership as part of the MLRS Fleet Expansion effort. The current Army Acquisition Objective is 225 MLRS launchers. The end state Army Acquisition Objective after Fleet Expansion will be 367 M270A2 MLRS launchers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
