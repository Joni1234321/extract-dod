"Justification: FY2022 procurement dollars support $7.192M Base, $0.000M Direct War, and $0.000M Enduring costs. FY2022 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.192 million support obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) fleet. HIMARS Modifications funding will include, but are not limited to, the following: updating the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle carrier and the Launcher-Loader Module drawing packages and Technical Data Packages through the prime contractor and the government product office; updating the Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals for Soldiers to perform operator maintenance; upgrading the Diagnostic Trainers and HIMARS Mock-up Trainer due to obsolescence. Systems engineering efforts will address obsolescence issues and apply necessary modifications to the major HIMARS components of the Carrier, Launcher- Loader Module, and Fire Control System. Base procurement dollars will also incorporate modifications to the HIMARS launcher to meet the current and evolving threat. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
