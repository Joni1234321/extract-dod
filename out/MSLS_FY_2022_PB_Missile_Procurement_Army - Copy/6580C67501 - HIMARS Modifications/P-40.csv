"Description: The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and future Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-Unitary (GMLRS-U), GMLRS Alternative Warhead, the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and future MFOM to include the Extended Range (ER) GMLRS, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). Mod 1 (M142 Mods). Modifications to address safety, operational-related, chassis, and Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) obsolescence issues within the HIMARS fleet. Additionally, procures system-specific training devices required to support the HIMARS Vehicle and Maintainer training courses. Mod 2 (CFCS). Modifications to field the Common Fire Control System (CFCS) to the HIMARS Launcher fleet. CFCS replaces the obsolete Universal Fire Control System that cannot be procured as designed. CFCS will provide the capability to launch all current and future MFOM and provide an updated and more intuitive user interface that will be common to both HIMARS and MLRS launchers. CFCS will reduce training costs and operations and maintenance costs. The fielding of CFCS on the HIMARS Launcher fleet mitigates obsolescence issues. Mod Kit 2 (CFCS) funding begins in FY2024. The Army currently has 363 HIMARS launchers on hand and is increasing the Army Acquisition Objective to 547 to support the Army Structure Memorandum 2022-2026 decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
