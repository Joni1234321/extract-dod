"Description: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) is a single man-portable/operable, light-weight organic, beyond line-of-sight, precision guided, loitering aerial missile system capable of locating and engaging obscured and/or fleeting enemy targets who otherwise cannot be engaged by typical direct fire weapon systems. Front and Side Look High Resolution Electro-Optical (day) and Front Look Infrared (night) cameras allow the Warfighter to have eyes on the target for positive identification. LMAMS Wave-Off capability allows the operator to wave-off or re-direct the LMAMS flight path prior to impact, if necessary. The system is comprised of a fire control unit, launcher, missile, and a modular payload capable of high lethality against unprotected Combatant Personnel and producing casualties against Personnel in Soft Skinned Vehicles. LMAMS has the ability to be employed in less than two minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
