"Description: THE P-40 QUANTITY FOR FY20 AND FY21 IS SUBJECT TO BE UPDATED WITH ACTUALS. Note: Beginning FY21, funds from System Integration and Test Procurement / C50016 were realigned into MSE Missile / C53101. The MSE Missile line supports the procurement of certified missile round and required ancillary hardware for production and fielding, Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), US Unique Engineering Services (ES), and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities. The PATRIOT Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) is a high velocity hit-to-kill, surface-to-air missile capable of intercepting tactical ballistic missiles, air breathing threats, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial systems. The PAC-3 MSE represents the next generation PAC-3 missile which provides expanded battlespace performance against evolving threats and has been fully integrated into the PATRIOT system for US and international partners. The PAC-3 MSE is an agile, lethal interceptor providing substantial missile capabilities when combined with critical ground system improvements. Additionally, the PAC-3 MSE enhances Insensitive Munitions (IM) through a less sensitive, increased performance lethality enhancer, the addition of armor and a thermally initiated venting system. A single canister design provides enhanced warfighter and logistics flexibility, and facilitates improved IM performance for greater warfighter safety. The PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Field Surveillance Program (FSP) is required to ensure that the reliability, performance, and safety of fielded missiles in the PATRIOT family remain within the classified system specification for the life of the system. Initial FSP tasks confirm the quality of design, materials, tooling and test equipment procedures, and processes used in the manufacture of the PATRIOT Family of Missiles (PFoM). After missile deployment, results from surveillance firings, inspections, functional tests, Storage and Aging Programs, and depot level missile maintenance processing provide the data required for the assessment of reliability, performance, and safety of the missile stockpile. The PFoM are fielded under the Certified Round Concept. Under this approved concept, the missiles are capable of being placed in extended storage as part of war reserve stocks or deployed in operational units for variable periods and then fired without intervening tests or checkouts. In accordance with the Certified Round Concept, the reliability/performance of the missile is certified by the Short and Intermediate Effectors for Layered Defense (SHIELD) Project Office to be at an acceptable level for a stated period of time or corrective action is taken. The certification of reliability is made possible through the use of the PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) contract to use technical support and knowledge of the testing of discrete lots of component parts, subassemblies and assemblies which the prime contractor Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) provides as the only source of technical knowledge, expertise, and facilities to perform FSP activities and process PFoM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
