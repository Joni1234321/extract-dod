"Justification: FY 2022 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $166.130M supports the production of 110 Early Operational Capability (EOC) PrSM missiles with Launch Pod Missile Containers (LPMC). FY 2022 procurement dollars support $38.139M Base, $0.000 Direct War, and $127.991M Enduring costs. FY21-24 procurement quantities support fielding an early operational PrSM capability under an Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) beginning in FY 2023. The UMR fielding is necessary to close the capability gap between the current capability and near-peer missile capabilities before the program transitions to Full Rate Production (FRP). On 3 FEB 2021 Army Futures Command, Commanding General signed a Directed Requirement for initial quantities of PrSM EOC. FY21-24 MIPA funds will initially support an EOC and then transition to Full Rate Production and achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY 2025. EOC production begins in FY 2021 with fielding occurring in FY 2023. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities. This program supports the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Team (CFT).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
