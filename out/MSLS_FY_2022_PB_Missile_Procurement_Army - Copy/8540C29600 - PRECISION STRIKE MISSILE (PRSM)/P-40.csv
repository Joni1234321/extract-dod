"Description: Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is the Army's next generation surface-to-surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. PrSM requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds two missiles, survivability in a threat environment, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A2 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). PrSM will meet cluster and insensitive munition requirements and is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. The mission of the PrSM System is to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. PrSM will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all- weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/ staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. PrSM will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. The current Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 3,986 PrSM missiles. The Army Procurement Objective (APO) for PrSM will be determined at Milestone B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
