"Justification: FY 2022 Base dollars in the amount of $25.253 million are designated for procurement of Integrated Logistics Support for the Interim CMD (IDDS-A) batteries. In response to National Defense Authorization Act for 2019, the Army approved a Directed Requirement to initiate procurement of the Israeli Iron Dome Missile System for an Interim CMD capability on 9 Feb 2019. To support the Interim CMD requirement, the Army procured two interim Iron Dome batteries from the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Following prerequisite events, the batteries will be available for deployment to meet the Army's requirements starting in FY 2022. The Army will continue to provide interim Integrated Logistical Support for these assets. Concurrently, the Army will integrate an enduring IFPC capability of a launcher and interceptor leveraging the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture and IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) as the Fire Control component, and US sensor (Sentinel) with initial system procurements starting in FY 2024 for fielding in FY 2026. This program supports the Air and Missile Defense Cross Functional Team (CFT).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
