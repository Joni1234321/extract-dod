"Description: The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher and interceptor integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission. The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non- kinetic defeat solutions. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an IFPC capability. In FY 2019, the Army signed a contract with the Israeli Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) for two Interim CMD (Iron Dome Defense System - Army (IDDS-A)) Batteries. For each of the interim capability's IDDS-A Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit (6 launchers per battery). IFPC's Interim CMD (IDDS-A) systems were delivered to the Army in FY 2021. Following prerequisite events, the batteries will be available for deployment to meet the Army's requirements starting in FY 2022. Concurrently, the Army is pursuing a Competitive strategy with Industry participating in a ""Shoot Off"" demonstration using Industries' proposed launcher and missile solutions integrated with the Army's IBCS and Sentinel radar. The Army will evaluate Industry proposals informed by models and simulations, hardware-in-the-loop, and live fire data, to make a Best Value recommendation to proceed to a single vendor to deliver the Enduring IFPC Inc 2 prototype solution. The Army will use a Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) Rapid Prototyping approach to evaluate new capability, provide residual operational capability in FY 2023, then transition into procurement and field by FY 2026.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
