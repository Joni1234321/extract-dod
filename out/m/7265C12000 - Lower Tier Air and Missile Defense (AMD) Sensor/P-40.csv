"Description: Lower Tier Air Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program will provide the required sensing capabilities, surveillance and fire control in the lower tier portion of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) of the ballistic missile defense battlespace. The LTAMDS capability increases sensor/radar performance to maximize the inherent PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) Interceptor capabilities to engage threats. The initial LTAMDS baseline established by the LTAMDS Rapid Prototyping effort will include the procurement of 16 sensors planned for fielding in FY25 through FY28. The additional quantities supporting the Army Acquisition Objective shall be fielded in FY28 through FY34 subsequent to baseline changes identified through Pre-Planned Product Improvement activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
