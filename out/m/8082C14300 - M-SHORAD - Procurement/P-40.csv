"Description: M-SHORAD is an Air Defense weapon system consisting of multiple ground-to-air missile launchers, sensors, and a gun integrated on a Stryker A1 combat vehicle providing the Army improved capabilities for defense of maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations. Specifically, maneuver formations require the improved M-SHORAD air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats. The M-SHORAD capability will be provided using an incremental approach as part of a Family of Systems (FoS) capable of operating individually and collectively to provide the scalability and flexibility to meet mission demands. The first increment is the rapidly fielded M-SHORAD Inc. 1 system supported by a Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Army Approved Directed Requirement informed by a FY17 M-SHORAD demonstration. Follow-on increments to the M-SHORAD FoS will be supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved Capability Development Document (CDD). This program supports the Air and Missile Defense Cross Functional Team (CFT).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
